	* Undirected Graphs

**Algorithms**
	* Numerical Methods	
		* Newton's Method of approximate
		* The Square Root Function
		* The Exponetial Function

##Part 2: Data Structures and Algorithms that actually matter

**Data Structures**
* Packets
* Database data structures: 
	* R-Tree
	* Kd-Tree
* DataFrames
* Matrix

**Algorithms**
* Linear Regression
* Support Vector Machine Prediction
* K-Means Clustering

* Boosting
* Random Forrests

##Part 3: Exotic Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures**
* Queue-like data structures
* To be continued

**Algorithms**
* Heat Transfer Equations
* Mixing Models
* To be continued

##Part 4: Automating Analysis

In this part of the book, the student will now be ready to handle _real_ analysis challenges, in an automated way.
Special effort and attention will be given to teach students how to handle real data, and how to automatically get real results.
Full automation will be expected.  Exercises will require a web interface as well as a database, visualization, and robust report generation

##Part 5: Predicting at Scale

In part 5 of the book, little attention was paid to deal with data or problems at scale.  In this part of the book, not only do the interfaces for potential users need to be as robust as possible, but analysis will need to cover many more test cases, in fact students will be expected to rigorously test their code for errors, as well as expect lots and lots of data, from potentially thousands of connections.

##Part 6: Analyzing Society

In part 6 of the book, we turn our area of skills towards analyzing real problems.  Here students will be given vague direction and expected to come up with compelling analysis, almost on their own.  Rigorous testing of code, visualization, and output will be expected.  

Some questions that will be asked:

1) Who will win the 2016 presidential election?

2) How many people are enslaved around the world?

	2a) How much does your iPhone really cost?

	2b) How much does your food really cost?

	2c) How much does your washing machine really cost?

3) When will global warming end humanity and what could we do to stop it?

4) When will China overtake america as the world's largest economy?

5) When will the Euro-zone collapse?

6) When will world war 3 start?

7) What will the next major political parties leanings be? When will it arise?  And where?

8) What will replace democracy as the ideology of governance?

9) Which celebrities will die in the next 10 years?

10) How long will you live? How long will your children live?  How long will your grand children live?

11) What will the next major evolution on earth look like?

12) How can we construct a vehicle capable of leaving our solar system?

13) How will we find life on other planets?

14) What does love mean?  And how do we find examples of it between two people?

15) What does it mean to hate someone?

16) How could you predict the 10 next best seller, by genre, theme, and approximate title?

17) How could you write a symphony?

18) How could you translate a song into a different genre?

19) How can you predict cancer? Heart disease? lung disease? kidney failure?

20) What are the qualities of your ideal mate?

Using the above analytic tools we will be able to answer all of these questions, with more precision, than you may have believed possible.
